# ðŸ›¡ **Authentication Verification via Signed Message Endpoint**

This endpoint allows for the retrieval of a message that users can sign to prove their ownership of a specific wallet address.

---

#### **Endpoint:**

```
https://encryption.lighthouse.storage/api/message/<walletAddress>
```

#### **Method:**

`GET`

---

#### **URL Parameters:**

- `wallet Address`: The specific wallet address for which the user wants to prove ownership.

---

#### **Success Response:**

**Code:** `200 OK`

**Content:**

```json
[
  {
    "message": "<Message to sign>"
  }
]
```

---

#### **Error Responses:**

**Code:** `400 Bad Request`

**Content:**

```json
{
  "message": "Invalid address"
}
```

---

#### **Notes & Usage:**

- The user should sign the provided message using their private key related to the wallet address in question. This signed message can then be used to verify the user's ownership of that specific wallet address.
- The system might send multiple identical messages for redundancy and verification purposes.
- Messages can be signed using both Ethereum-compatible wallets and Solana wallets.

---

{% hint style="info" %}
Always handle the message securely and avoid exposing your private keys during the signing process.
{% endhint %}

# ðŸ›¡ **Authentication Verification via JWT**

---

## ðŸ“„ **Get JWT Token Endpoint**

This endpoint allows users to retrieve a JWT (JSON Web Token) after they've signed a message with their wallet, confirming their ownership of a specific address.

---

#### **Endpoint:**

```
https://encryption.lighthouse.storage/api/message/api/message/get-jwt
```

#### **Method:**

`POST`

---

#### **Request Body Parameters:**

- `address`: The wallet address that the user wants to prove ownership of.
- `signature`: The signature generated after signing the message provided by the previous endpoint (`/api/message/<walletAddress>`).

---

#### **Headers:**

- `"Content-Type": "application/json"`

---

#### **Success Response:**

**Code:** `200 OK`

**Content:**

```json
{
  "token": "<YOUR_JWT_TOKEN_HERE>"
}
```

---

#### **Error Responses:**

**Code:** `400 Bad Request`

**Content:**

```json
{
  "error": "Invalid address or signature"
}
```

---

#### **Notes & Usage:**

- After obtaining the message from the `/api/message/<walletAddress>` endpoint, users should sign it using their Ethereum-compatible or Solana wallets. This signed message (signature) and the wallet address should then be passed to this endpoint to retrieve the JWT token.

- The JWT token can be used for authentication in subsequent API calls within the Lighthouse Encryption system(recommend for multiple uploads or download on our encryption service).

---

{% hint style="info" %}
Ensure you store the received JWT token securely and do not expose it. This token serves as a proof of authentication and could be misused if obtained by malicious actors.
{% endhint %}

---

With the JWT token in hand, you can now authenticate and interact with other secured endpoints in the Lighthouse system. Always remember to include the JWT in the header of your requests where authentication is required.

#### **Method:**

`POST`

---

#### **Request Body Parameters:**

---

- `data`: An object containing the WebAuthn public key credential details:

  - `authenticatorAttachment`: Describes which attachment modality was selected by the user. Example: `cross-platform`.

  - `rawId`: Raw credential ID in binary form. Example: `Af_Afcbl3pONtRLg...kU-R0`.

  - `response`: An object containing response details:

    - `attestationObject`: Contains attestation data for the created public key credential. Example: `o2NmbXRkbm...TNsqfc0sY`.

    - `clientDataJSON`: Serialized client data used by the authenticator to generate the attestation object. Example: `eyJ0eXBlIj...NzI6MzAwMCIsImNyb3NzT3JpZ2luIjpmYWxzZX0`.

  - `type`: Type of the credential. Example: `public-key`.

---

- `address`: The wallet address that the user wants to prove ownership of. Example: `0x254511193Dd29f9c3c474c43B8d23C3d367Bc4A8`.

---

- `signature`: The signature generated after signing the message provided by the previous endpoint (`/api/message/<walletAddress>`).

---

#### **Success Response:**

**Code:** `200 OK`

**Content:**

```json
true
```

**Notes:** A response of `true` indicates successful registration with WebAuthn.

---

#### **Error Responses for both endpoints:**

**Code:** `400 Bad Request`

**Content:**

```json
{
  "error": "Invalid data or address format."
}
```

**Code:** `401 Unauthorized`

}
```

**Code:** `500 Internal Server Error`

**Content:**

```json
{
  "error": "Server error, please try again later."
}
```

---

#### **Notes & Usage:**

- The registration process involves two main steps:

  1. Initiate the registration by sending the user's address to the `start` endpoint. This returns challenge data which is then used in the WebAuthn `navigator.credentials.create()` function.
  2. Complete the registration by sending the generated credential data to the `finish` endpoint.

- Always ensure you handle the challenge data and serialized credential data securely.

---

{% hint style="info" %}
Use the Bearer Authorization token (signed message) for authenticating API requests. Always renew the signed message if it expires or is invalidated.
{% endhint %}

---

By following these steps, users can register securely using WebAuthn with the Lighthouse system. Always ensure the security and integrity of the data exchanged during the registration process.
